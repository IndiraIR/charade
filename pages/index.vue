          <p>In Cuba the charada is a table of 100 numbers, the first 36 come from the Chinese Charada, and the rest come from the popular Cuban imagination. In the Cuban tradition, dreams are related to the charade numbers and their corresponding representations. </p>

          <p>The interpretation of these dreams is often described as "cabal" in the neighborhoods of the country, and they are used to bet on the popular illicit game known as  La Bolita. </p>
